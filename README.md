Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Virtualenv (for managing Python environments)
- Pip (for installing dependencies)

Setup Instructions

1. Create Virtual Environment

Start by creating a virtual environment to isolate your dependencies.

# Install virtualenv if you don't have it already
pip install virtualenv

# Create a new virtual environment
virtualenv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

2. Install Dependencies

After activating your virtual environment, install the required dependencies:

# Install the required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

requirements.txt should include the necessary libraries for Flask and the background removal model (e.g., Flask, numpy, tensorflow, etc.).

3. Set Up Static and Templates Folders

The application uses the static and templates folders to store assets like images, CSS, and HTML files.

- Static Folder: This folder will contain static files such as images and CSS.
  - Path: project_name/static/

- Templates Folder: This folder will contain the HTML templates used to render the front-end of the app.
  - Path: project_name/templates/

4. Running the Application

To run the application locally, use the following command:

# Run the Flask application
python app.py

The app should now be running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ by default.
